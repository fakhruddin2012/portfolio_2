      <description>In this project my aim was to classify the car brands by seeing the image of the car. I am using Deep Learning&amp;rsquo;s Resnet50 model architecture in this project. The final accuracy which I got after 50 epochs was 92.19%. Below graphs show the training and validation accuracy and loss      Link to GitHub Repository</description>

      <description>This is a Machine learning project. In this project I am trying to predict the fare of flights by training the dataset which contain data for one year. At first dataset required cleaning as most of the columns were categorical so I converted them into numerical. I did feature engineering to get dates months from the existing columns. I dropped the additional info and route columns as most of the values were missing or of no use.</description>

      <description>In this, we have to predict the number of positive and negative reviews based on sentiments by using different classification models. I have used three classification models. I observed that both logistic regression and multinomial naive bayes model performing well compared to linear support vector machines.  Link to GitHub Repository</description>
